  Description: Leyahn is one of the fastest people in Ennisia, and also the sneakiest.
    She can fall from the top of a roof and make no noise, and can kill someone before
    he feels the pain of her claws. Leyahn lost her family from a young age and resorted
    to theft to survive. Thus she had to run and hide all her life, until a famous
    thief found her and raised her.
  Catchphrase: If I need a weapon, then I need more training.
