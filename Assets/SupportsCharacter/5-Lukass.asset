  description: "Lukass is a high ranking noble in the kingdom of Xothio. At an early
    age he was scared of everything, and it wasn\u2019t until his father gave him
    a shield that he started leaving the house. He is now a great Shield-Bearer and
    protects the people of Xothio with his shield. He has a great sense of justice
    and chivalry."
