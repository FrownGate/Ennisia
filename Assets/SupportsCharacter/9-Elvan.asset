  description: He is the son of the Elven chief, and next in line to become chief.
    To subdue the pressure he decided to learn the way of the sword. He became unrivaled

    He has great respect for his father and his goal in life is to make him proud.
  catchPhrase: I cannot disappoint my father, I will lead the elven kingdom to greatness.
