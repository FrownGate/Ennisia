  Description: A general of the Human army, rumored to be the strongest; he is known
    for his great sword skills, and his cunning mind. He is very cocky and believes

    however, he has a heart of gold, and would do anything for his Queen.
  Catchphrase: Know your place, peasant! You are unworthy of facing me.
