  description: Hem and Mily are elven twins that cannot be separated. Even Though
    they are two different people, they share the same thoughts and thus consider
    themselves as one. Since their birth they have been very close to the forest
    of Xothio, and developed a knack for healing and herb treatments. It is said
    that they can heal any wound and cure any sickness.
