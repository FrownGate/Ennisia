Name;Dialogue
Me;*Oww... My head hurts...*
Me;*WoW what is that! It's a tiny, flying girl... Where am I?!*
?????;Hello sleepy head! 
?????;You look shocked! Guess you never seen a fairy before, my name is Raida! What's your name?
Raida;You don't remember huh? No biggie I'm sure it'll come back!
Raida;In the meantime let me tell you what's going on in Ennisia, since you seem to have forgotten.
Raida;First of all, Ennisia is split into four quadrants, one for each nation.
Raida;The Human kingdon is called Anthrena, the Beast kingdom is called Thitria, the Demon kingdom is called Daissera 
Raida;and finally the Elf kingdom is called Xothio, which is where we are right now!
Raida;3 months before we found you, the Demon king woke up from his 1000 years slumber and started his conquest.
Raida;He first conquered the kingdom of Thitria then quickly moved onto the kingdom of Anthrena.
Raida;For the last 2 months his army has been at our border, but thanks to our think forest they haven't been able to breach our defences.
Raida;We found you at the border of Xothio and Anthrena in really bad shape but thankfully alive, so we brought you were you are now!
Raida;Where are you exactly? 
Raida;Well you are in the headquarters of the resistance, settled deep in the forest of Valstisia, the capital of Xothio.
Raida;Now I'm leaving you with a choice to join us or leave and enjoy the rest of your life, so which one will it be?
Me;*Oww! My head... is this a memory? I see demons killing and destroying an entire village...Omg! I remember... *
Me;*It's my family! My mother, father and brother all dying while I'm hiding like a coward...How could I have done that?!*
Me;*I feel so ashamed! I need to avenge them, I can't let the demons get away with this...I'll take revenge on the demons for my family!*
Raida;So! Have you made your choice? Looks like you have a different look in your eyes, did you remember something?
Raida;It's a yes?! Yayy perfect, I knew you'd say yes! Well I'll show you around then.
