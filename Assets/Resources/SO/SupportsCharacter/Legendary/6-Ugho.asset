  Description: "No one knows how old Ugho truly is as no one has ever seen his face,
    it is rumored that he fought the demon king 1000 years ago and that he hasn\u2019t
    died because the demon king still lives. His raw magic is rumored to be limitless
    and so powerful that he secludes himself in the mountains, waiting for the demon
    king\u2019s return."
  Catchphrase: The demon king will pay for his crimes, and I will be the judge.
